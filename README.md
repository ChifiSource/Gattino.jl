  <p> Prrty is a module for creating interactive dashboards using the Julia language. As of now, there is no stable release, currently working to develop the base strong enough to actually do something -- it is coming soon, though! Prrty.jl is intended to be <a href = "https://github.com/ChifiSource/Toolips.jl">Toolips.jl</a> based., so if you would like to know how the project is going, that might be a good place to start!</p>
